re.factored is a project by students for students. We know first-hand about CMSs that are hard to navigate and highly restricted. Our goal is to give you, the student, a user-driven collaborative environment. Because re.factored is meant to be an invaluable utility used everyday, we made sure that this site is highly accessible and can quickly bring users to what they need. That doesn't mean we need to sacrifice looks, though – we still believe in a modern, clean, and usable design that makes school life just a bit easier.
